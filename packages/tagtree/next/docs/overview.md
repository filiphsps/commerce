# @tagtree/next

Next.js storage adapter for [`@tagtree/core`](/docs/tagtree-core/overview/). Delegates
read/write to Next's `unstable_cache` and invalidation to `revalidateTag`.

For the canonical reference, see the
[README on GitHub](https://github.com/filiphsps/commerce/blob/master/packages/tagtree/next/README.md).

## Why a special adapter

Next's data cache lives inside the runtime and is not addressable from outside
the framework — there's no `get(key)` API. The standard `read` + `write` adapter
contract therefore cannot apply. Instead, the Next adapter implements `wrap`
natively, delegating the entire cache-aside flow to `unstable_cache`. `read`
returns undefined, `write` is a no-op; both exist only to satisfy the contract.
