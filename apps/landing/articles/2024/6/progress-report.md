Howdy!

We got some news to share, and it's a big one. Most of the previous management team has decided to leave the company, and we're now in the process of rebuilding with our new team. This means that we're going to have to pivot a bit, and we're not entirely sure what the future holds for us. We're still going to be working on the same projects, but we're going to have to rethink our strategy a bit.

We're still aiming for a release sometime in the future, but we're not entirely sure when that's going to be. We're going to keep you updated as we go along, and we're going to make sure that we're as transparent as possible.

Until next time!
