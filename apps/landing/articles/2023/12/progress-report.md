Sadly we haven't been able to release the much (internally) anticipated `v2.0` of Nordcom Commerce/Sweet Side of Sweden; but that's actually a good thing! We've been able to focus on the quality of the release and make sure that it's as good as it can be. We're now aiming for a release in January 2024 instead.

## Increased scope

As the timeframes have shifted a bit we've also been able to increase the scope of the release. A whole lot more of multi-tenancy support has been added, and we have even started
experimenting with a dashboard layout. Now this isn't final by any means; in fact it'll be
completely redesigned and replaced, but it has served as a way to test [`Nordstar` our open-source Component Library](https://github.com/NordcomInc/nordstar/tree/master) and Design System for building human-centric user interfaces.

## Ending notes

Changes will be included in the next progress report, and we'll also be able to share more details about the release then. Until then, have a great holiday and a happy new year!
