# Storefront Polish Loop — running log

Branch `dev/storefront-polish-loop`. Each Ralph iteration takes one focused slice of the
storefront (UX/UI polish, DRY extraction, token-driven configurability, cross-engine/responsive
validation), commits logically, and pushes before the next iteration.

Guiding principles (from the task + repo design system):

- Every visual resolves from P3 semantic tokens (`--surface-*`, `--text*`, `--state-*`, …) so a
  theme-less shop renders sensibly and a tenant theme recolors the set. No hard-coded Tailwind colors.
- Pin new text-on-surface token pairs to WCAG AA in `design-tokens.gate.test.ts`.
- Break large components into reusable primitives; extract similar-intent components into generics.
- Keep JSDoc on every function/component; canonical Tailwind; American English.

## Iterations

### 1 — Alert: token-driven surfaces, legible foregrounds, a11y role

- `components/informational/alert.tsx` was the design system's outlier: hard-coded `bg-yellow-200`
  (no tenant could recolor it), and the `error` severity set a saturated `--state-danger` background
  with **no foreground**, leaving illegible dark `--text` on red. No ARIA role on urgent alerts.
- Promoted warning to themeable sources `--color-warning-light` / `--color-warning-dark` and a
  `--surface-warning` / `--text-warning-strong` token pair (mirrors the success pair) in `globals.css`.
- Reworked Alert to map each severity to a surface + explicit on-surface ink (`error` → white on
  danger, the gate-certified pairing; `warning` → warm-brown on amber; `success` → strong green ink),
  and derive an ARIA role (`alert` for warning/error, `status` otherwise), caller-overridable.
- Extended `design-tokens.gate.test.ts`: pinned the new token literals to their sources and asserted
  `--text-warning-strong` on `--surface-warning` clears WCAG AA normal.
- Verified: biome clean, storefront typecheck clean, gate (19) + blocks (18) tests pass.

### 2 — Variant badges: tokenize the last hard-coded badge fills

- Swept all components for hard-coded colors outside the gate's banned subset. Only outliers:
  `product-display/primitives/variant-badges.tsx` hard-coded `bg-purple-600` (gift card) and
  `bg-blue-600` (subscription), while vegan/sale/free-shipping already read tokens.
- Promoted both to themeable `--badge-gift-card-bg` / `--badge-subscription-bg` tokens (defaults keep
  the exact prior purple/blue), so a tenant can recolor every overlay badge. Collapsed `h-3 w-3` →
  canonical `size-3`.
- Gate: pinned both token literals and asserted white-on-badge clears WCAG AA normal (both ~5.2:1).
- Verified: biome clean, typecheck clean, gate 21/21.

### 3 — Product-card wrappers: extract a generic, close the recommendation gap

- `collection`/`recommendation`/`search` product-card wrappers were near-identical thin delegations,
  but `recommendation` rendered the raw `SURFACE_PRESETS.recommendation` instead of the shop cascade —
  so tenants could theme collection/search cards but **not** recommendation cards (configurability gap).
- Extracted `components/products/surface-product-card.tsx`: one generic that resolves any `surface`
  through the full cascade (instance → per-surface selection → store base → preset → built-in) and
  renders `ProductCard`. All three wrappers now delegate, pinning only their `surface` + display name.
- Recommendation cards are now tenant-customizable like the rest; no-extensions shops stay byte-identical.
- Added an extensions test locking that the recommendation surface honors store base + per-surface
  selection over the preset.
- Verified: biome clean, typecheck clean, extensions 3/3 + presets pass.

### 4 — Alert info severity gets its own surface

- The `info` severity rendered on neutral `--surface-1`, visually indistinguishable from a plain card.
- Added a light-info surface (`--color-info-light` → `--surface-info`) paired with the existing
  dark-blue info ink (`--text-info-strong` ← `--color-block-info-dark`), so info now reads as
  informational. Severity color system is complete: success/warning/error/info/callout each distinct.
- Gate: pinned both tokens and asserted AA (~6.1:1).
- Verified: biome clean, typecheck clean, gate 22/22.

#### Candidate slices for future iterations (audit backlog)

- Hard-coded-color sweep is now clean for named Tailwind utilities + raw hex in components/blocks.
- Cross-engine/responsive validation (Safari + Chromium) of header mega-menu, gallery lightbox,
  rail carousel per the overhaul spec root-causes — needs a running storefront + browser.
- Verify responsive + Safari/Chromium behavior of interactive components (header mega-menu, product
  gallery lightbox, rail carousel) per the overhaul spec root-causes.
- Extract repeated card wrappers (collection/recommendation/search product cards) — confirm they are
  already thin wrappers over the product-card primitives or DRY them further.
